I am a Machine Learning Researcher working at [RBC Research](http://rbcresearch.com/){:target="_blank"} at Toronto, ON, Canada. I am interested in a wide range of topics of related to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### Brief Bio

Before joining RBC, I was an Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [Kindred AI](https://www.kindred.ai/){:target="_blank"} , where I worked on robotics and machine learning.

I was a research scientist (January 2014 to April 2015) working with [Dr. Graham Taylor](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gwtaylor/){:target="_blank"} in [School of Engineering](http://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/){:target="_blank"}, [University of Guelph](http://www.uoguelph.ca/){:target="_blank"}, Canada. There, I worked on deep learning and representation learning.

I got my Master of Applied Science degree from [School of Engineering Science](http://www.ensc.sfu.ca/){:target="_blank"} at [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/){:target="_blank"} (Burnaby, BC, Canada). I worked on medical image analysis with [Dr. Mirza Faisal Beg](http://www2.ensc.sfu.ca/~mfbeg/){:target="_blank"}. At SFU, I worked on 2 projects: 1) analysis of spatial-temporal zebrafish heart optical mapping data; 2) automated detection of retinal fluids from OCT images.

I got my Bachelor of Engineering degree from [School of Advanced Engineering](http://sae.buaa.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (academic talent program) at [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} (Beijing, China), where I studied Automation, specifically, flight control system.

I spent nearly 20 years at [Handan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handan){:target="_blank"}, Hebei, China (河北, 邯郸) before college.
