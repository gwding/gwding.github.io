title: AdverTorch&#58; A toolbox for adversarial robustness research
---

This is a short summary of the AdverTorch project that I lead. It is a Python toolbox for adversarial robustness research. The primary functionalities are implemented in PyTorch. Specifically, AdverTorch contains modules for generating adversarial perturbations and defending against adversarial examples, also scripts for adversarial training.

The github repo is [here](https://github.com/BorealisAI/advertorch/).

The tech report is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07623).

We also have a blog post [here](https://www.borealisai.com/en/blog/advertorch-adversarial-training-tool-implement-attack-and-defence-strategies/) on BorealisAI website.
